# Reprappable laser

Using Rishalaser as a base.
Focusing first on ultra-low cost for use with textiles & paper,
with long-term goal of having high enough power to cut itself and similar structures.

## Milestone 1: Raster firmware

* First raster-capable open source firmware
* See ../brushless/mtr

## Milestone 2: Simplified mechanics

* CoreXY architecture.
* Using string (Nylon) instead of belts
* Tape (Kapton/Scotch) slide-bearings [inspiration](http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3554)

## Milestone 3: 

* Discrete custom H-bridge w/microcontroller
* Firmware runs directly on this microcontroller

## Milestone 4: Fabbable steppermotors

* 3d-printed or lasercut bobbins and structure

## Milestone 5: Custom CO2 laser tubes

* See [Kreatures work](http://hackaday.com/2015/09/13/building-a-3d-printed-laser-tube/)
* If one can get them up to 20+ watt, should be able to reproduce
