# TapeXY

Experiment in super low-cost XY stage, for uses in digital fabrication techniques
which have minimal weight and forces on head (laser engraving, 3d-printing).

Key features:

* Using Kapton tape as basis for gliding surfaces,
inspired by [a design](http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3554) by Peter Jansen
* Using braided Nylon/Polyamid wire ("Spectra line") instead of timing belts.
Like on Tantillus and some Delta printers.
* Reproduction with primarily lasercutter (or CNC mill), in wood/acrylics.
* [CoreXY](http://corexy.com) kinematics
